# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT: Exposed Resend API Key

## Issue Discovered
- **Date**: July 21, 2025
- **Issue**: Resend API key `re_9dYSBUup_372aqzc7KUiUmMLrimP9w8gE` was exposed in git repository history
- **Location**: Documentation files (now deleted) contained the API key
- **Detection**: GitGuardian security alert

## Immediate Actions Required ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Revoke Compromised API Key
- [ ] Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
- [ ] Find the key: `re_9dYSBUup_372aqzc7KUiUmMLrimP9w8gE`
- [ ] Click "Delete" or "Revoke" to deactivate it immediately

### 2. Generate New API Key
- [ ] In Resend dashboard, click "Create API Key"
- [ ] Name it: "Production API Key - July 2025"
- [ ] Copy the new key (starts with `re_`)

### 3. Update Environment Variables
- [ ] Update your local `.env.local` file with new key
- [ ] Update Vercel environment variables:
  - Go to Vercel dashboard
  - Select your project
  - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
  - Update `RESEND_API_KEY` with new value
  - Trigger new deployment

### 4. Security Best Practices Going Forward

#### Git Repository Security
- ‚úÖ `.env*` files are already in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in current codebase
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful when creating documentation files with examples

#### Recommended Actions
1. **Enable branch protection** on GitHub main branch
2. **Add pre-commit hooks** to scan for secrets
3. **Regular security audits** of repository history
4. **Use environment variables only** - never hardcode API keys

## Files That Contained the Exposed Key
The following files (now deleted) contained the API key:
- `RESEND_SMTP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Various troubleshooting documentation files

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Files containing the key have been removed
- ‚úÖ Current codebase uses environment variables properly
- ‚ùå **API key still needs to be revoked and replaced**

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATELY** revoke the old API key in Resend
2. Generate new API key
3. Update all environments (local + Vercel)
4. Test email functionality
5. Monitor for any unauthorized usage

## Prevention
- Never include API keys in documentation
- Use placeholder values like `your_api_key_here` in examples
- Always double-check git commits before pushing
- Consider using tools like `git-secrets` to prevent future incidents
